# Set up a data subject right request widget

## Process

The process of data subject right request via the widget is as shown in the diagram below:

## Setting up

DASTRA allows you to put a data subject right request widget directly on your website, that can be accessed by anyone via a simple button, as currently done on its [privacy policy](https://www.dastra.eu/fr/privacy-policy):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (70).png>)

By clicking on the "Access online service" button, a window will appear, allowing the Internet user who wishes to make their request:

To set up such a widget, simply configure your widget using our right exercice widget editor functionality.
