# Create or modify an audit template or PIA

## Introduction

Creating or modifying an audit template or PIA in Dastra is a breeze. To do so, access the "Audit" functionality.

## Create or modify an audit / PIA template

To create an audit or PIA template, click the "Create Template" button on the "Audit" tab. Then you can select one of the 3 types of audit templates that exist in Dastra: automated, combined or custom.

This brings you to the template type selection interface:

* By clicking on the "Automated Audit" tab, you will choose an existing predefined audit template from the Dastra Audit Library.&#x20;
* By clicking on "Combined Audit" will combine multiple audits into one.&#x20;
* By clicking on "Custom Audit" you can build your own audit template.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike automated audits, custom audits are fully customisable. Based on the answers selected by respondents, you will be able to automatically generate an action plan or map the risks associated with the model.
{% endhint %}

## Create a PIA template

PIA templates are included in the automated audit templates and are freely accessible from the Dastra library. To create or modify a PIA template, click on "Automated Audit", then select "PIA (CNIL) - Privacy Impact Analysis" before clicking "save".

{% hint style="info" %}
In Dastra, PIAs are one of several automated audit models.
{% endhint %}

Once you have selected the template, you will be taken to the planning screen where you can perform one of the 2 actions below:

* either modify the template by clicking on the "Modify template" button or&#x20;
* schedule an audit by clicking on the "Schedule an audit" button

{% hint style="info" %}
For PIAs, an additional option is possible, if applicable: import your PIA from the CNIL tool. To do this, click on the "Import your CNIL PIA" button.&#x20;

Indeed, it is possible to import a PIA made by the CNIL tool. The CNIL PIA must be extracted in .json format and imported into Dastra.&#x20;

A large part of the elements will be included in the Dastra PIA.

## Automated audit templates&#x20;

Dastra offers a number of automated audit templates to document compliance and drive processes.&#x20;

For example, templates for legitimate interest assessment (LIA) and transfer out of the EU (TIA) are included in the application.

## Customised audit templates

In Dastra, you can create your own custom audit template. To do this, click on the "Custom Audit" option. This will take you to the audit template editing interface.&#x20;

Build the audit template you want and click on "Save and Continue".

## Items audited

You can link audits to items in Dastra. By choosing the type of item being audited, you force all audit responses based on that template to be linked to an object of the chosen type. For example, you can choose that this audit template will always be linked to a process.
