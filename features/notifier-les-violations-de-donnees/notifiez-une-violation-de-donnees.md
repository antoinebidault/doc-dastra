# Report a data breach

There are 2 possible ways to fill in a new data breach notification in DASTRA:

1. Fill in any new notification directly by hand
2. Import notifications by excel, csv or text file

### Manual creation of a data breach notification

By clicking on the "New incident report" button, a window appears where you can detail the data breach. Click on "Save and exit". That's it, you've created your first data breach notification manually!
