# Report a data breach

There are 2 possible ways to fill in a new data breach notification in DASTRA:

1. Fill in any new notification directly by hand
2. Import notifications by excel, csv or text file

### Manual creation of a data breach notification

By clicking on the "New incident report" button, a window appears where you can detail the data breach. Click on "Save and exit". That's it, you've created your first data breach notification manually!

A window appears with an "import" button. Click on it, download the registry template and follow the instructions to import the violations into Dastra. Once imported, the request will be directly available in the data breach register.
