# Manage data breach notifications

All organizations that process personal data must put in place measures to prevent data breaches and to react appropriately in the event of an incident.

For more information on what is a data breach and the obligations for companies:

## Why implement a data breach register?

Article 33.5 of the RGPD requires each organisation to maintain documentation of data breaches.&#x20;

Beyond the regulatory obligation, the storage and analysis of incident reports are essential to comply with notification obligations and to identify preventive measures to be implemented.&#x20;

See: [https://www.dastra.eu/fr/data-breach](https://www.dastra.eu/fr/data-breach)

## Data breach notification registry

DASTRA allows you to establish a register of data breach notifications. To do this, go to the DASTRA application, then click on the Incident report module available in the banner on the left of the screen:

The data breach notification registry appears.

## Notify a new data breach

There are 2 possible ways to fill in a new data breach notification in DASTRA:

1. Fill in any new notification directly by hand
2. Import notifications by excel, csv or text file

### Manual creation of a data breach notification

By clicking on the "New incident report" button, a window appears where you can detail the data breach. Click on "Save and exit". That's it, you created your first data breach notification manually!

### Import / export of the data breach register

The entire data breach register is importable and exportable. To import a violation, click on the three vertical points on the right of the screen.

A window appears with an "import" button. Click on it, download the registry template and follow the instructions to import the violations into Dastra. Once imported, the request will be directly available in the data breach register.
