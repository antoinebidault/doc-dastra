# Dashboard

## Introduction&#x20;

The Dastra dashboard is the first page you see when you enter your workspace, and is a summary of your RGPD compliance. It is composed of 3 main sections:&#x20;

* The feature bar on the left of the screen,&#x20;
* The community tab on the right of the screen,&#x20;
* The section in the center containing the tiles summarizing the news and the watch of your space, and the different features.

## The tiles of the dashboard

In the section containing the tiles, you can change the order of appearance of these tiles by clicking on the drag and drop button to move the order of appearance of the tile.
