# Advanced Filters

## Use

Advanced filters allow you to filter your data on almost any field in your entities.&#x20;

* Go to a Dastra module (for example, the data subject rights module)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Combo of advanced filters for exercise requests&#x20;

_The combination of these filters is cumulative. For example: if I filter on one or two tags "Access" and "pending" + I select an organizational unit "Dastra SAS": it will show me all rows that contain the 2 tags "complex" and "pending" and that are in the organizational unit "Dastra SAS"._
{% endhint %}

* If you don't find any filters that suit you, you can click on the "Add filter" button. There you can edit the combination of filters that best suits your needs By default, Dastra persists the filters you select, which means that if you change pages or refresh your browser, the filters are retained. These filters are specific to your browser and workspace (they are stored in LocalStorage).&#x20;

## Known problems&#x20;

### My data is not displayed anymore?&#x20;

If you encounter difficulties with the filters: you lose the display of your data, we recommend you to clear the browser data (cookies, localstorage...). This will reset the status of your filters in your workspace.&#x20;

### Some columns are not present in the advanced filters?&#x20;

It may not be technically possible to set up these filters for various reasons. In this case, we recommend that you either export the data in a raw form, and run the report in tools like Excel.&#x20;

If it's a filter that is essential to your business, do not hesitate to ask us for a new feature.
