# Custom fields

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is still in beta. It may still have some instabilities.
{% endhint %}

## When to use custom fields?

There may be some information specific to your industry that is not present in the native fields of the treatment register, such as rights exercises, tasks, etc.&#x20;

Dastra will allow you to create custom form fields that you can easily add to enrich the data entered.&#x20;

Here is an example of a field configuration for the actor:

<mark style="color:red;">/IMAGE</mark>

And here is the result in the form:

<mark style="color:red;">/IMAGE</mark>
