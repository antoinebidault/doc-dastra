## Importing data into Dastra

Dastra allows you to easily import your own data in spreadsheet format directly into the application.

Imports are possible in the following modules:

* import of the record&#x20;
* import of actors&#x20;
* import of assets&#x20;
* import of datasets&#x20;
* import of fields&#x20;
* import of security measures&#x20;
* import of categories of persons concerned&#x20;
* import of audit responses&#x20;
* import of audit models (to come)&#x20;
* import of risk types&#x20;
* import of rights exercise requests&#x20;
* import of data breaches&#x20;
* import of tasks

In each import, the process is the same.

It is done in 4 steps:

1. Preparation of the data file&#x20;
2. Downloading the file
3. Verification of data before import
4. Importing the data
