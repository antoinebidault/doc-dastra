# Create your action plan

## Introduction

Creating and tracking a data protection task has never been easier with Dastra's scheduling module. In Dastra, a task is a job that needs to be done.

## To create a task, two possibilities:

* Either you create a task directly in the action plan
* Either you create a task directly in another module of the application (processing register, data breach notifications, cookies ...)

### Create a task in the action plan

In the main page of the "planning" module, click on "new task". A new "New task" window appears on the right of the screen allowing you to describe the desired task. Once described, click on save.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each task in Dastra can be assigned to an item in the application, for example :&#x20;

* A process&#x20;
* An application&#x20;
* An actor / subcontractor&#x20;
* A set of data&#x20;
* A security measure&#x20;
* An audit / PIA&#x20;
* An exercise of rights&#x20;
* An incident&#x20;

Once these tasks have been created and associated, you will be able to find them directly in the file for each of these elements under the "Tasks" tab.
{% endhint %}

### Create a task directly from another Dastra module

Dastra allows you to create a task when you think about it, directly within the operational processes:

* Editing a data processing

* Management of a request for exercise of rights

* Data breach notification

* Generating tasks from an audit

{% hint style="info" %}
An action plan can also be generated automatically following the completion of an audit. For more information, see the section "Planning an audit".
{% endhint %}

### Creating subtasks

It is possible to create a list of subtasks to each task in Dastra. To do this, edit a task and click on the "add subtask" button.

## Assigning a task

When creating the task, you will have the option to assign the task to a Dastra user, either as an "owner" or as a "contributor". These people will be notified by email when a task is modified.

## Editing a task

To edit a task, simply click on the three dots to the right of a task, and select "Edit".

{% hint style="info" %}
To change the status of a task even more easily, you can "click and drop" it from the "table" tab, which allows tasks to be divided into 4 status columns: "new", "additional information required", "in progress", "done". You can also customise the status columns.
{% endhint %}

## Archive or delete a task

In Dastra, it is possible to archive or delete a task from the task drop-down menu accessible by clicking on the three dots on the right.
