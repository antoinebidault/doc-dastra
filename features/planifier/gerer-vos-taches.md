# Create your action plan

## To create a task, two possibilities:

* Either you create a task directly in the action plan
* Either you create a task directly in another module of the application \(processing register, data breach notifications, cookies ...\)

### Create a task in the action plan

In the main page of the "planning" module, click on "new task". A new "New task" window appears on the right of the screen allowing you to describe the desired task. Once described, click on save.

### Create a task directly from another Dastra module

Dastra allows you to create a task when you think about it, directly within the operational processes:

* Editing a data processing
