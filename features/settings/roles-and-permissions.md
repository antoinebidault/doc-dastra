# Roles and permissions

## General Functioning

Each user can be associated with 1 or more roles. The roles are themselves associated with a list of permissions (e.g.: write in the registry, post a request to exercise a right...). There are two ways to manage the roles associated with users.&#x20;

* If you are an owner, you can use [this account management interface](https://app.dastra.eu/general-settings/users?q=\&page=1\&size=20)
* If you have the role of entity administrator, you can manage the roles and permissions of users belonging to your entity using [this interface](https://app.dastra.eu/general-settings/roles).

## Create your own roles
