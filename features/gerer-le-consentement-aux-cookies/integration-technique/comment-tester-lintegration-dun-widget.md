The preview mode will disable the widget cache and allow you to view your configuration changes live. Localhost domains will also be allowed.

## You can use the following api key

```
dastra00-0testing1-key
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This key will display an example consent widget. It's not possible to modify the configuration of this one. The purpose of this key is to perform integration tests in a jsFiddle...
{% endhint %}
