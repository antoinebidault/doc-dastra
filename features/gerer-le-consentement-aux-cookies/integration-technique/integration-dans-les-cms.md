# Functioning of the widget

## Overall operation:

Overall, the consent widget works in 3 main steps:&#x20;

1. The **proposal** of the consent window&#x20;
2. The **collection** of consent (storage of evidence)&#x20;
3. The actual **execution** of the user's consent

{% hint style="info" %}
The Dastra widget can cover the first two steps partially automatically. For the third step of actually enforcing the user's cookie preferences, you will need to technically integrate the consent system with third-party services that may potentially set cookies. See the [Blocking Cookies Guide](blocage-des-cookies/) for more information.
