# Wordpress

## 1. Retrieve the SDK

Once you have finished configuring and designing the Dastra cookie consent widget, you can retrieve the SDK in the "Code" section.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find this piece of code and copy / paste it here: Cookie consent&gt; Edit&gt; Code
{% endhint %}

## 2. Copy and paste in the Wordpress editor

Once the code is retrieved, go to the administration console of your Wordpress site. 

Click on the "Appearance" button in the vertical banner on the left of the screen, then on the "Theme Editor" button.

 Select the "Footer.php" file on the right of the screen that appears, then insert the code previously retrieved from Dastra at the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag \(just before &lt;/body&gt;\).

Save by clicking on "Update file", then refresh the page of your website. That's it, the banner appears!
