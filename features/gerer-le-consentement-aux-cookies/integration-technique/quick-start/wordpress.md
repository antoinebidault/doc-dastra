# Wordpress

## 1. Retrieve the SDK

Once you have finished configuring and designing the Dastra cookie consent widget, you can retrieve the SDK in the "Code" section.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find this piece of code and copy / paste it here: Cookie consent> Edit> Code
{% endhint %}

## 2. Copy and paste in the Wordpress editor

Once the code is retrieved, go to the administration console of your Wordpress site.&#x20;

Click on the "Appearance" button in the vertical banner on the left of the screen, then on the "Theme Editor" button.

&#x20;Select the "Footer.php" file on the right of the screen that appears, then insert the code previously retrieved from Dastra at the end of the \<body> tag (just before \</body>).

Save by clicking on "Update file", then refresh the page of your website. That's it, the banner appears!
