# Manage cookies consent

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small files that store information about a user visiting a website, for example their browsing history, site settings, etc.

Cookies can be defined as a _series of information, usually small and identified by name, which can be transmitted to your browser by a website on which you connect. Your web browser will keep it for a certain period of time, and send it back to the web server each time you reconnect to it._

The entry into application of the general data protection regulation \(GDPR\) on May 25, 2018, reinforced the requirements regarding the validity of consent  Directive 2002/58 / EC "privacy and electronic communications", or "ePrivacy". It provides in particular for the obligation, without exception, to collect the consent of users before any operation of writing or reading cookies and other trackers.

The compliance of cookie consent can be ensured by a cookie consent widget.
