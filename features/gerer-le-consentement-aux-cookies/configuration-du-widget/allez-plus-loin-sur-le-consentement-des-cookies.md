# Go further on cookie consent

DASTRA's Cookie Consent module also allows you to go further in managing your cookies, making cookie consent really effective.

In addition to the scanning, classification, cookie widget and proof-of-consent features, DASTRA also allows you to:

* Access a configured API&#x20;
* Implement prior consent&#x20;
* Implement natively the integration of a "Google Tag Manager" layer&#x20;
* Insert custom html or javascript code snippets&#x20;
* Generate statistical reports&#x20;
* Integrate consent
