# Classify cookies by consent categories

With DASTRA, you can classify via a simple "drag and drop" the cookies deposited on your website, by broad category of purpose:

* "**Strictly necessary**" cookies: these are cookies that are exempt from consent by their nature (for example, session or consent cookies)&#x20;
* "**Preferences**" type cookies&#x20;
* "**Audience analysis**" type cookies&#x20;
* "**Marketing and user experience**" cookies&#x20;
* Other cookies.

{% content-ref url="the-purposes-of-cookies.md" %}
[the-purposes-of-cookies.md](the-purposes-of-cookies.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

To do this, simply select the cookie to be classified from the Classification interface, then move it by simply "clicking and dropping" it to the category of your choice.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can define whether or not consent is required for each cookie on a case-by-case basis.
{% endhint %}

Once you have categorized all your cookies, you can implement the corresponding consent widget.
