# Cookies scanning

DASTRA allows you to scan the cookies placed on your website thanks to its **cookie scanning** functionality, directly integrated into its "Cookie consent widget" module.

## Access the "scan cookies" function Dastra

You must first log into your Dastra workspace. To learn how to do this, go to the following page:

{% page-ref page="../../../commencer/premieres-etapes.md" %}

Then, you must go to the "Consent to cookies" module, and click on the "New widget" button.

## Scan the cookies placed on your website

Once in the "Scan cookies" section, simply enter the domain name of your website in the space reserved, and click on "Submit".

{% hint style="info" %}
Your domain name must include the entire prefix "https: // www." to be taken into account by our engine. Websites without SSL are not eligible to the scan feature.
{% endhint %}

Wait a few seconds, and that's it, the cookies placed on your website are identified!

Once the cookies placed on your website are scanned, you can proceed to their classification.
