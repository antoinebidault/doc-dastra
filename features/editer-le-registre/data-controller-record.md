# "Data controller" record

## Introduction

Article 30 of the GDPR sets out specific obligations for the personal _data controller record_ and the _data_ _processor record_. If your organization acts as both a processor and a controller, your record must therefore clearly distinguish between the two categories of activities.

**In practice, in this case, the CNIL recommends that you keep 2 records:**

1. one for the processing of personal data for which you yourself are responsible,
2. another for the processing operations that you carry out, as a data processor, on behalf of your clients.

The rest of this page deals only with the "Data controller" record.

## The "Data controller" record

For each processing operation, the record of a controller shall indicate at least:

1. where applicable, **the name and contact details** of the joint data controller of the processing operation
2. the **purposes** of the processing, the objective for which you have collected the data
3. the categories of **data subjects** (customer, prospect, employee, etc.)
4. the categories of **personal data** (e.g. identity, family, economic or financial situation, banking data, connection data, location data, etc.)
5. the categories of **recipients** to whom the personal data has been or will be communicated, including the data processors you use
6. **transfers** of personal data to a third country or to an international organization and, in certain very specific cases, the guarantees provided for these transfers;
7. the **time limits for the erasure** of the various categories of data, i.e. the retention period, or failing that the criteria for determining it
8. to the extent possible, **a general description of the technical and organizational security measures** that you implement
