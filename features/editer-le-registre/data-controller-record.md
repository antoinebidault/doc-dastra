# "Data controller" record

## Introduction

Article 30 of the GDPR sets out specific obligations for the personal _data controller record_ and the _processor record_. If your organization acts as both a processor and a controller, your record must therefore clearly distinguish between the two categories of activities.

**In practice, in this case, the CNIL recommends that you keep 2 records:**

1. one for the processing of personal data for which you yourself are responsible,
2. another for the processing operations that you carry out, as a subcontractor, on behalf of your clients.

The rest of this page deals only with the "Data controller" record.
