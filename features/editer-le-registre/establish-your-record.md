# Establish your record

## To set up your record in Dastra, there are two possibilities:

* Either you already have a record, in which case you can import it into Dastra&#x20;
* Or you don't have one, and you must create it from scratch and use the proposed treatment models as a guide

## Upload your existing record

With Dastra, you can easily upload your existing treatment record instead of having to manually enter it, regardless of the current format - excel, text or csv.
