# Stakeholders

You can indicate the actors involved in the implementation of the processing. This can for example be a service or a department of a company (such as the human resources department for example) but also a dedicated person if it's a project (project manager for example).

You also indicate the identity of the representative of the controller, if applicable, of the joint controller(s).

## Add a joint controller (co-controller)

To add a joint controller, add a new stakeholder and select "Joint controller".&#x20;

You will be prompted to add a stakeholder as a joint controller.
