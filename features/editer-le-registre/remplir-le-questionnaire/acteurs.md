# Stakeholders

You indicate here the identity of the controller, if any, of the joint controller \(s\). You can also indicate the name of the DPO of each controller.

You can also indicate the actors concerned by the implementation of the processing. This can for example be a service or a department of a company \(such as the human resources department for example\) but also a dedicated person if it is a project \(project manager for example\).
