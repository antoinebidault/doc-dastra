# Purposes

A **purpose** is the objective pursued by the creation of your file. It indicates what the processing of personal data will be used for, its raison d'être. This objective must be clear and understandable.

The definition of the purpose is fundamental because it is a prerequisite for the other elements framing the processing such as the data retention period, the adequacy, the relevance, the proportionality of the data as well as the accuracy and the updating of the data.

[**Article 5 1. b) of the GDPR**](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) provides that the purpose must be determined, explicit and legitimate.

**The purpose must be determined:** the purpose must be defined with sufficient precision to adapt the necessary data protection guarantees and in order to define the scope of data processing. The level of detail required depends on the particular context of the data collection and the data involved. Sometimes simple language will be enough. For example, a local family business will not require the same level of detail to describe the purpose of the customer file as for a multinational using complex algorithms allowing personalized offers and targeted advertising. The purpose must be determined before the processing is carried out.

**The purpose must be explicit**: the purpose must not be ambiguous and must be clearly expressed.

**The purpose must be legitimate**: legitimacy refers to the legal basis on which the data processing required by [_article 6 of the GDPR_](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) is based.

This notion also requires finality not to contravene the law in general. For example, the purpose will not be legitimate if it leads to discrimination prohibited by the penal code. We can take into account labor law, consumer law or contract law in particular.

In addition, it is necessary to take into account the context of the processing in order to assess the legitimacy and, in particular, the reasonable expectations of the data subject.

A processing activity can have several purposes. For example, the “recruitment” activity could have two distinct purposes: the analysis of applications and the management of interviews, as well as the creation of a CV-library.

## **Lawful basis for processing**

For each purpose, you must define the applicable [**legal basis**](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/). There can only be one legal basis per purpose. The choice of this legal basis must be made according to the context of the processing.
