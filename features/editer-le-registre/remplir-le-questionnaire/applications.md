# Applications

For example, if you use CRM software, add it to this list. This will allow you to master the data carriers and to link your applications to your data catalog. You can quickly and simply specify the types of data processed through this processing activity. The applications are not necessarily linked to subcontractors. This may, for example, be software installed on the server without intervention by the publisher in the processing of personal data.
