# Assets

This is where you fill in the applications, software or other that are used to **store personal data**.&#x20;

_For example, if you use a CRM software, add it in this list._&#x20;

This information, **which is not mandatory for the register**, allows you to **map the application chain linking the data together**.&#x20;

**The objective is to allow you to control the data carriers and to link your assets to your data catalog.**&#x20;

You can thus quickly and **simply specify the types of data processed through this processing activity**.&#x20;

NB: Assets are not necessarily linked to subcontractors. Indeed, it can be for example a **software installed on the server without intervention of the editor in the processing of personal data**.
