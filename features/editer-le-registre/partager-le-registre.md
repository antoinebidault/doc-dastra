# Share the record of processing

## Sharing the entire record

From the "Record" section of DASTRA, click on the arrow in the upper right-hand corner of the registry next to the "create treatment" button, then in the drop-down menu, click on "Share".&#x20;

Once clicked, a window appears on the screen asking you the expiration date of the sharing link, then click on "Create a link".

The sharing will take into account all the treatments with the status "published". Treatments in draft are not shared with this function. To share a treatment, in draft, it must be shared individually.

The lifetimes of the links are as follows:&#x20;

* 2 days&#x20;
* 30 days&#x20;
* 120 days&#x20;
* unlimited

{% hint style="info" %}
The share link is a limited lifetime link that you can use to share the registry with external users. The link is publicly visible, which is why you have to be careful about how it is distributed. For security reasons, it is recommended to monitor the sharing links exposed on your project. .
{% endhint %}

## Generation of a sharing link for data processing

Repeat the process described above, but by clicking on the three-stroke button specific to the processing activity you wish to share, then click on "Share".

Treatments can be shared regardless of the status (published or draft).

It's also possible to share several treatments by selecting them in the Record menu and choosing the grouped action "Share".

## Manage share links

All the sharing links created in your workspace are centralized in the management console (Settings menu).&#x20;

You can view them and delete them if necessary.
