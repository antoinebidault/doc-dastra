Once clicked, a window appears on the screen asking you the expiration date of the sharing link, then click on "create a link".

{% hint style="info" %}
The share link is a limited lifetime link that you can use to share the registry with external users. The link is publicly visible, which is why you have to be careful about how it is distributed. For security reasons, it is recommended to monitor the sharing links exposed on your project. .
{% endhint %}

## Generation of a sharing link for data processing

Repeat the process described above, but by clicking on the three-stroke button specific to the **** processing activity you wish to share, then click on "share".
