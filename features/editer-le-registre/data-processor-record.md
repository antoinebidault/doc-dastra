# "Data processor" record

## Introduction

Article 30 of the GDPR sets out specific obligations for the personal _data controller record_ and the _data_ _processor record_. If your organization acts as both a processor and a controller, your record must therefore clearly distinguish between the two categories of activities.

**In practice, in this case, the CNIL recommends that you keep 2 records:**

1. one for the processing of personal data for which you yourself are responsible,
2. another for the processing operations that you carry out, as a data processor, on behalf of your clients.

The rest of this page deals only with the "Data processor" record.

## The "Data processor" record

Each data processor is required to fill out a less extensive record.&#x20;

This record contains :&#x20;

* the **contact details of the data processor**, its representative, if applicable, and its DPO&#x20;
* the **contact details of all data controllers on whose behalf the data processor acts** (usually the clients)&#x20;
* the **categories of data** processed&#x20;
* the **recipients**&#x20;
* the **transfers** outside the EEA&#x20;
* the **security measures**
