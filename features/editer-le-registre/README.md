# Record of processing activities

## Introduction

The record of processing activities allows you to map your **data processing** and to have **an overview** of what you do with the personal data concerned. Having a completed register is a **requirement** of Article 30 of the GDPR, but beyond the binding aspect, it is above all **a tool to better understand your data** and **control the associated value chain** - from their production to the use that is made of them.

At Dastra, we believe that our role is to **make it easier** for you to map your treatments, so that you can focus on your business. To do this, we support you with an **intelligent** registry and **questionnaires** that guide you step-by-step through the creation of your registry.

## The Dastra record in a few words

Dastra's record of processing activities log functionality meets all regulatory requirements. The records, both Processor and Subcontractor, are based on repositories (actors, assets, datasets, data, risks and security measures) allowing you **to map your processing activities** and **save time** in the daily management.

Treatments can be duplicated and treatment models are available in a library freely accessible to all our users. A workflow is integrated, a search function is natively present and it's possible to import / export treatment sheets in different formats (pdf, word, html, excel, csv, json). It's possible to attach attachments, violations or risks to these treatments.

## Record "Data controller" versus "Subcontractor"

Article 30 of the GDPR sets out specific obligations for the _controller's record_ and the _processor's record_. If your organization acts as both a processor and a controller, your record must therefore clearly distinguish the two categories of activities.

**In practice, in this case, the French CNIL recommends that you keep 2 records:**

1. one for the processing of personal data for which you yourself are responsible,
2. another for the processing operations that you carry out, as a subcontractor, on behalf of your clients.

## The different methodologies for setting up the record of processing activities

There are two methodologies for creating a treatment record:

* **Top-Down design**: we start the project by establishing the inventory of data processing, and then we collect the information specific to each processing (data, subcontractors...etc...).
* **Bottom-Up design**: we start by making an inventory of the data (software, data sets and personal data fields) and we create the treatments from it.

### Which record methodology to choose?

There is no right or wrong method, everything will depend on the context of your organization, the skills of the DPO team, the accessibility of the operational data...

Here is a table comparing the two approaches:

| Methodology               | Target                                                                                                     | Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Top-Down (descending)** | Small organizations or communities Company with a weak data culture Legal team with little affinity for IT | Quick to set up Less work Corresponds well to the legal expectations of the GDPR                                                                                                                                                                                                            | May cause difficulties if the registry implementation team is not familiar with the organization's data More burdensome for operational staff The data inventory will be much less valuable because it is modeled for legal purposes only More complex to maintain over the long term |
| **Bottom-Up (ascending)** | Large or medium-sized organizations With a strong data culture Legal team with a strong IT affinity        | Taking an inventory of data will be less abstract than creating processes directly. The record reflects the reality of the organization Maintaining the record will be easier in the long run More members of the organization are involved Creation of treatment records is more automated | Overall more difficult and time consuming to implement Project requires good governance                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The good news is that Dastra handles both approaches perfectly! You can either create a form automatically by taking a treatment template. If you prefer the automatic approach, it's possible to create your own data map and create a treatment directly from an asset (software, database).
