# Record of processing activities

## Introduction

The record of processing activities allows you to map your **data processing** and to have **an overview** of what you do with the personal data concerned. Having a completed register is a **requirement** of Article 30 of the GDPR, but beyond the binding aspect, it is above all **a tool to better understand your data** and **control the associated value chain** - from their production to the use that is made of them.

At Dastra, we believe that our role is to **make it easier** for you to map your treatments, so that you can focus on your business. To do this, we support you with an **intelligent** registry and **questionnaires** that guide you step-by-step through the creation of your registry.
