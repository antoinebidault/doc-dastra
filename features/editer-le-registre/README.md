# Edit the record of processing

## What is a record of processing?

The record of processing allows you to map your data processing and to have an overview of what you do with the personal data concerned. Having a completed record is an obligation of article 30 of the GDPR, but beyond the binding aspect, it is above all a tool for better knowing your data and mastering the associated value chain - from their production to the use that is made of it.

At Dastra, we believe that our role is to make it easier for you to map your processing, so that you can focus on your job. To do this, we support you through an intelligent record of processing and a questionnaire that guides you step by step in building your register.
