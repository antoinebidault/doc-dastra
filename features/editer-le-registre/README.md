# Record of processing activities

## Introduction

The record of processing activities allows you to map your **data processing** and to have **an overview** of what you do with the personal data concerned. Having a completed register is a **requirement** of Article 30 of the GDPR, but beyond the binding aspect, it is above all **a tool to better understand your data** and **control the associated value chain** - from their production to the use that is made of them.

At Dastra, we believe that our role is to **make it easier** for you to map your treatments, so that you can focus on your business. To do this, we support you with an **intelligent** registry and **questionnaires** that guide you step-by-step through the creation of your registry.

## The Dastra record in a few words

Dastra's record of processing activities log functionality meets all regulatory requirements. The records, both Processor and Subcontractor, are based on repositories (actors, assets, datasets, data, risks and security measures) allowing you **to map your processing activities** and **save time** in the daily management.

Treatments can be duplicated and treatment models are available in a library freely accessible to all our users. A workflow is integrated, a search function is natively present and it's possible to import / export treatment sheets in different formats (pdf, word, html, excel, csv, json). It's possible to attach attachments, violations or risks to these treatments.

## Record "Data controller" versus "Subcontractor"

Article 30 of the GDPR sets out specific obligations for the _controller's record_ and the _processor's record_. If your organization acts as both a processor and a controller, your record must therefore clearly distinguish the two categories of activities.

**In practice, in this case, the French CNIL recommends that you keep 2 records:**

1. one for the processing of personal data for which you yourself are responsible,
2. another for the processing operations that you carry out, as a subcontractor, on behalf of your clients.
