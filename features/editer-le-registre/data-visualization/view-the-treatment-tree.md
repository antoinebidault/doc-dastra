# View the treatment tree

## Introduction

In Dastra, data can be visualized in several ways. One of them is the visualization of **the treatment tree** by entities and departments.&#x20;

This visualization allows you to understand to which entities and/or departments the treatments are attached.

## View the treatment tree

To view the treatment tree, click on the "Record of processing activities" module and then click on the arrow to the right of the button, to select the "Tree view" option.
