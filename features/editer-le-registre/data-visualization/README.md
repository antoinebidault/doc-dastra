# Data visualization

## Introduction

In Dastra, **data** can be **viewed** in several ways:&#x20;

* The **treatment organizational tree**,&#x20;
* The **data mapping** of the treatment register,&#x20;
* Data **transfers**.

## Change the Registry view

To change the way treatments are displayed in your registry, go to the "Record of processing activities" module in the left-hand banner of the screen. By default, the treatments are displayed in table mode. Click on the **arrow to the right** of the "List view" button.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first choice "List view" refers to the standard view of the **treatment record.**
{% endhint %}

In addition to the table view, a list view and a tree view are also available.

{% content-ref url="view-the-treatment-tree.md" %}
[view-the-treatment-tree.md](view-the-treatment-tree.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## View the mapping of your record and transfers

The record data map and the transfer map are available in the tabs at the top of your screen, above your list.

{% content-ref url="view-the-record-data-map.md" %}
[view-the-record-data-map.md](view-the-record-data-map.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="view-the-transfer-map.md" %}
[view-the-transfer-map.md](view-the-transfer-map.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
