# View the record data map

## Introduction

In Dastra, data can be visualized in several ways. One of them is the mapping of **the treatment record data**.&#x20;

This visualization allows in particular to explore, analyze and understand the relationships between the data in the record.

## View the record data map

To view the mapping of the registry data, click on the "Record of processing activities" module and then click on the "**Graphs**" button above your treatment list.
