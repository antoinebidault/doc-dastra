## Record export

To export the entire record, simply go to the "Record of processing activities" module, click on the arrow at the top right next to the creation of a treatment, then select "Export".

Then choose the export format as well as the type of export desired (complete or article 30 format), and click on "Download file". That's it, your record is exported !

### Article 30/CNIL format

The so-called article 30 format corresponds to what is required by the GDPR. The export will take into account the mandatory fields according to the GDPR. Indeed, the GDPR requires the creation of the record of processing activities. The information contained is:

* Name of the treatment&#x20;
* Purposes (without legal basis)&#x20;
* Data and storage&#x20;
* Recipients and possible transfers&#x20;
* Security measures

### Complete format

The complete format is the native Dastra format. You export all the fields that make up the treatment form.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's also possible to export only one or several treatments of the record, instead of the whole record. To do this, select the concerned treatments manually by checking the boxes on the left of the record, then "Select a batch action" and "Export".
{% endhint %}

## Record import

In order to avoid filling in each processing by hand and to take into account all possible record formats, Dastra has designed a methodology based on the principle of **segregating the record into data domains**. Thus, 7 steps are recommended to import an entire existing record into Dastra.

{% hint style="info" %}
These steps, which are not mandatory, are nevertheless strongly recommended, especially when the processing record contains many treatments.
{% endhint %}
