# Upload your existing record

To avoid having to complete each processing manually and to take into account all possible formats of record of processing, Dastra has designed a methodology based on the principle of **segregation of the record into different data domains**. 

Thus, 9 steps are recommended to import the whole of an existing record into Dastra.

{% hint style="info" %}
sThese steps, which are not compulsory, are nevertheless strongly recommended, especially when the record of processing contains many processing activities.
{% endhint %}

Do not hesitate to also consult the data protection local authorities referentials made available by Dastra on the following page:

## Step 1: Upload data processing labels
