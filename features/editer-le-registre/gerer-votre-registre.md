# Design and manage your record

## There are two possibilities for establishing your record of processing in Dastra:

* Either you already have a record, in which case you can download it in Dastra
* Or you don't have it, and you have to create it from scratch.

## Upload your current record of processing

With Dastra, you can easily upload your existing record of processing instead of having to enter it manually, regardless of the current format - excel, text or csv.

To upload your current record, click on the "import your data" tab in the Record section:

Then download a sample of our file, fill it with your existing processing and import it directly into our interface by drag and drop.

The result should be as follows:

Congratulations, your record of processing has been successfully imported!

## Create a new record of processing from scratch

With Dastra, a record is automatically created as soon as the workspace is defined. If you do not want to download an existing record, you can start filling it immediately the one created by default by creating your first processing activity. If you want to know how, click on the following link:
