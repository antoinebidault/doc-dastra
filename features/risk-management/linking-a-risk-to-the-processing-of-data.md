You will be taken to a risk edit page and you can start to fill in the information about the risk you have identified.&#x20;

You can then find all the risks in your register in the risk repository.

You can also attach a risk to a treatment directly from the risk management module.&#x20;

To do this, simply go to the "Risks" tab and "create an evaluation".

## Visualising the risks of a treatment

To view the risks on treatments, it is necessary to go to the Dastra Risks module.
