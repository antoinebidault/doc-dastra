# Risk management process

The risk management process in Dastra is a simplified version of the eBios Risk Manager model and the CNIL risk assessment methodology.

It is composed of 4 steps:&#x20;

1. Identify - feared events, objectives, threats, sources of risk, control points and log of past events, etc.&#x20;
2. Assess - using the Probability x Impact method&#x20;
3. Monitor - respond to risks&#x20;
4. Control - via checkpoints, DMR, current risk assessment etc.

The unique feature of the Dastra risk management process is that it allows the risk assessment to be updated in near real time, based on the results of the checkpoints.
