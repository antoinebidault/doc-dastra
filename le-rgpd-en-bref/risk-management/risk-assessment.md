# Risk assessment

## Risk assessment

A risk can be evaluated with the following formula:

$$
Risk=Probabilityâˆ—Impact
$$

Where the **probability** is the frequency of occurrence of a hazardous event and/or a hazardous element, and the **impact** is the severity of the effects and/or the severity of the consequences of this hazardous event.

The impact of a risk is classified by default in 4 categories:&#x20;

* Catastrophic,&#x20;
* Significant,&#x20;
* Medium,&#x20;
* Low.

The probability of a risk is classified by default in 4 categories:

* Very likely,&#x20;
* Likely,&#x20;
* Possible,&#x20;
* Unlikely.

## Risks classification

Depending on their level of probability and impact, risks can be classified into several categories:&#x20;

* Intolerable risks;
* Risks that must be limited as much as possible;
* Acceptable risks either because the probability and/or the severity of the risk is/are negligible compared to other risks.

Unacceptable risks are shown in **red** in Dastra.&#x20;

Risks that should be limited as much as possible are represented in **orange** or **yellow** in Dastra.&#x20;

Acceptable risks are shown in **green** in Dastra.

## Gross risk vs. net (or residual) risk

A "**gross**" risk is considered without all of the surrounding control systems - organization, various controls, documentation, etc.&#x20;

A "**net**" (or residual) risk, on the other hand, is evaluated by taking into account all the systems already in place and effective.
