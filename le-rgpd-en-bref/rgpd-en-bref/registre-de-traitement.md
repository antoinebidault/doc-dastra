# Record of processing

## Definition of the record of processing

The record of data processing activities provides a clear and structured mapping of all personal data processing operations and will be the starting point for control by the Data Protection Authority.

The record is provided for in [Article 30 of the GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj#d1e3265-1-1). It participates in the documentation of compliance.&#x20;

As an inventory and analysis document, it must reflect the reality of your personal data processing and allow you to precisely identify:&#x20;

* the **stakeholders** (representative, subcontractors, co-managers, etc.) involved in the data processing,
* the **categories of data processed**,
* **what the data is used for** (what you do with it), **who accesses** the data and **to whom it is communicated**,
* **how long you keep it**,
* **how it is secured**.

## Why a registry?

The record is made **mandatory** by Article 30 of the RGPD. Beyond the response to the obligation provided for by Article 30, the record is a **tool for monitoring and demonstrating your compliance with the RGPD**.&#x20;

It allows you to document your data processing and to ask yourself the right questions: do I really need this data for my processing? Is it relevant to keep all the data for so long? Is the data sufficiently protected? Etc.&#x20;

Its creation and updating are thus an opportunity to **identify and prioritize the risks** with regard to the RGPD. This **essential step** will allow you to deduce an action **plan for the compliance** of your processing with the data protection rules.
