# Impact assessment

## What is a PIA?

The **data protection impact assessment** is a compliance mechanism provided for in [Article 35 of the GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj#d1e3546-1-1).&#x20;

It aims to ensure compliance with the GDPR and to provide proof of it!&#x20;

The analysis consists in **identifying and minimizing the risks** of infringement of the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned in a processing of personal data.&#x20;

It's mainly a **study of the risks for the individuals and not for the organization**!&#x20;

The PIA is a document broken down into three parts:&#x20;

* A **detailed description** of the processing implemented, including both technical and operational aspects;&#x20;
* The **assessment**, of a more legal nature, of the **necessity and proportionality** concerning the non-negotiable fundamental principles and rights (purpose, data and storage periods, information and rights of individuals, etc.), which are set by law and must be respected, whatever the risks;&#x20;
* The **study**, of a more technical nature, of **the risks to data security** (confidentiality, integrity and availability) as well as their potential impact on privacy, which makes it possible to determine the technical and organizational measures necessary to protect the data.

## Perimeter of the PIA

The PIA may involve:&#x20;

* A **single treatment**&#x20;
* **Similar processing operations**&#x20;
* Identical processing operations carried out by several data controllers&#x20;
* Processing shared by several controllers&#x20;
* Similar processing operations in terms of purposes, functionalities, risks, technologies, etc.&#x20;
* A **technological product** (hardware or software)

An impact assessment must be carried out if the processing operation entails a **high risk** for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.&#x20;

By rights and freedoms is meant not only the right to privacy but also other fundamental rights, such as freedom of movement, non-discrimination, the right to life, etc.

High-risk treatments can be identified if they meet at least 2 of these criteria below (source: EDPD):&#x20;

* Evaluation/scoring&#x20;
* Automatic decision with legal or similar effect&#x20;
* Systematic monitoring&#x20;
* Sensitive data&#x20;
* Large scale&#x20;
* Cross-referencing of data&#x20;
* Vulnerable persons&#x20;
* Innovative use&#x20;
* Blocking a right/contract&#x20;
* Transfer outside EU
{% endhint %}

## When should I do a PIA?

* Before the implementation of the processing&#x20;
* Privacy by design principle&#x20;
* Tool to help you decide on the implementation of the processing&#x20;
* Allows to anticipate compliance costs&#x20;
* Must be done for existing processing&#x20;

PIA is an ongoing process:&#x20;

* PIAs should be reviewed regularly&#x20;
* A good practice is to update it every 3 to 5 years&#x20;
* In any case, as soon as a change occurs in the processing

## How to make a PIA?

**By first assessing the measures of necessity and proportionality. This is a thorough examination of the treatment from every angle!**&#x20;

You have to ask yourself questions and explain your choices on the following aspects of the processing:

* Purposes: determined, explicit and legitimate&#x20;
* Basis: lawfulness of processing, prohibition of purpose creep&#x20;
* Data minimization: adequate, relevant and limited&#x20;
* Data quality: accurate and kept up to date&#x20;
* Retention periods: limited

**Then by detailing the measures to protect the rights of the persons:**&#x20;

* information of the persons concerned&#x20;
* collection of consent, if necessary&#x20;
* exercise of the rights of access and portability&#x20;
* exercise of the rights of rectification and erasure&#x20;
* exercise of the rights to limit processing and to object&#x20;
* relations with processors&#x20;
* safeguards surrounding the international transfer(s)

It's necessary to use sectoral reference systems, codes of conduct, labels and brands.

**And finally, analyze the risks for the individuals concerned: potential privacy breaches**&#x20;

For each **feared event** (illegitimate access to data, unwanted modification of data and disappearance of data):&#x20;

* determine the potential **impact** on the privacy of data subjects if it were to occur;
* estimate the **severity** of the event, including the harmfulness of the potential impacts and, if applicable, the measures that could modify them;&#x20;
* identify the **threats** to data carriers that could lead to this feared event and the sources of risk that could cause it;&#x20;
* estimate its **likelihood**, particularly in terms of the vulnerabilities of the data carriers, the capabilities of the risk sources to exploit them, and the measures that could modify them.

Determine whether the **initial risks** can be considered acceptable given the existing or planned measures.&#x20;

If not, propose **additional measures** and re-evaluate the level of risk in light of these measures to determine the **residual risk**.

## Who is involved?

* **The data controller** (DC)&#x20;
  * The Data Controller's teams, including the teams of the business line concerned (MOA, MOE), the compliance officers, the legal teams&#x20;
  * The DC can delegate to external advisors but this remains under his responsibility
* **The DPO**&#x20;
  * Advice and verification of execution, evaluation of measures and residual risks, suggests the PIA&#x20;
* **Data subjects (or their representatives), if applicable**&#x20;
  * Their opinion can be taken and documented&#x20;
* **The processors**&#x20;
  * Assistance and provision of information&#x20;
* **The CISO or the IT department**&#x20;
  * Proposal to conduct a DPIA, assistance
