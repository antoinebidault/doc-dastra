# Impact assessment

## What is a PIA?

The **data protection impact assessment** is a compliance mechanism provided for in [Article 35 of the GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj#d1e3546-1-1).&#x20;

It aims to ensure compliance with the GDPR and to provide proof of it!&#x20;

The analysis consists in **identifying and minimizing the risks** of infringement of the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned in a processing of personal data.&#x20;

It's mainly a **study of the risks for the individuals and not for the organization**!&#x20;

The PIA is a document broken down into three parts:&#x20;

* A **detailed description** of the processing implemented, including both technical and operational aspects;&#x20;
* The **assessment**, of a more legal nature, of the **necessity and proportionality** concerning the non-negotiable fundamental principles and rights (purpose, data and storage periods, information and rights of individuals, etc.), which are set by law and must be respected, whatever the risks;&#x20;
* The **study**, of a more technical nature, of **the risks to data security** (confidentiality, integrity and availability) as well as their potential impact on privacy, which makes it possible to determine the technical and organizational measures necessary to protect the data.

## Perimeter of the PIA

The PIA may involve:&#x20;

* A **single treatment**&#x20;
* **Similar processing operations**&#x20;
* Identical processing operations carried out by several data controllers&#x20;
* Processing shared by several controllers&#x20;
* Similar processing operations in terms of purposes, functionalities, risks, technologies, etc.&#x20;
* A **technological product** (hardware or software)

An impact assessment must be carried out if the processing operation entails a **high risk** for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.&#x20;

By rights and freedoms is meant not only the right to privacy but also other fundamental rights, such as freedom of movement, non-discrimination, the right to life, etc.
