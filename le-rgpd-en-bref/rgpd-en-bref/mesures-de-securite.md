# Security measures

## The GDPR strengthens the obligation of data security.

Securing personal data involves identifying and implementing examples of security measures proportionate to the risk identified by acting on:

* the "elements to be protected" \(data\): minimize, encrypt, anonymize, etc.
* "Potential impacts" \(erasure, data breach\): encryption, allowing to save data, trace activity, manage data breaches etc.
* "Sources of risk" \(uncontrolled access, maintenance application, etc.\): control access, manage third parties, fight against malicious code, etc.
* The "supports" \(servers, networks, workstation ...\): pseudonymisation, anonymisation, reduction of material vulnerabilities, software, networks, paper documents etc.
* "Cross-cutting actions" at entity level, the personal data protection policy integrates the protection of personal data in projects

Examples of security measures:

* Access rights
* Encryption
* Data masking
* Pseudonimization
