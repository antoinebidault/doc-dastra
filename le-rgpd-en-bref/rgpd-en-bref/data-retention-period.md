# Data retention period

## Definition of retention periods

Retention periods are one of the fundamental principles of personal data protection.&#x20;

The principle of limited retention periods enshrines the right of individuals to be forgotten.&#x20;

An obligation resulting from Article 5 of the GDPR:

* **Identifiable form**&#x20;
  * Personal data may be retained in a directly or indirectly identifying form indefinitely by organizations within certain limits.&#x20;
* **Necessary for the purposes**&#x20;
  * Data must be processed for a limited period of time, in a manner consistent with the objective pursued (i.e. the purpose).

A **requirement for documentation** in the record provided for in Article 30 of the GDPR:

An obligation to provide information to data subjects under Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR:

It is thus necessary to determine :&#x20;

* A fixed retention period, according to the life cycle of the data.&#x20;
* An objective criterion used to determine this duration.

## The data life cycle&#x20;

The data life cycle can be broken down into three stages:

{% hint style="info" %}
The [French CNIL guide on retention periods](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guide\_durees\_de\_conservation.pdf) (in French)provides clarification on the documentation to be provided on retention periods:&#x20;

* The **record** in which the processing activities and the related retention periods must appear;&#x20;
* A **reference document** centralizing, for example in the form of a table, the duration of the different phases of the data's life for each processing operation (the SIAF's recommendations can be included, if necessary, in the structure's internal archive management tables);&#x20;
* The **different actions undertaken**, including if these actions are still in progress;&#x20;
* The **written instructions** given to the subcontractor regarding time limits;
* The **possible procedures for archiving data**, and in particular in the case of compulsory payment for the definitive archiving of public records (payment slip, etc.);&#x20;
* The **procedure for the destruction of data**, if applicable (e.g.: disposal slip, etc.);&#x20;
* **Authorization management policy** and **authorization matrix** for archiving, etc.
