# Personal data

Personal data is all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

A natural person can be identified:

* either directly \(example: surname and first name\)
* or indirectly \(example: telephone number, social security number, email or postal address, but also voice and image\)

The identification of a natural person can be carried out:

* from a single data \(example: name\)
* from the cross-referencing of a set of data \(example: a woman living at such an address, born on such a day and member of such an association\)

However, the contact details of the company are not, in principle, personal data \(example: generic email company1@email.fr\)
