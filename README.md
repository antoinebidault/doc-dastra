# What is Dastra

**Dastra** is a data privacy solution with which data protection teams can drive and manage all GDPR use cases, from managing the registration of processing activities to implementing a cookie widget on their websites.&#x20;

We aim to help data protection teams raise **awareness** across their business and **improve the GDPR experience** with a streamlined solution providing a single response to organizations' different GDPR needs, through:&#x20;

* A fast, intuitive and ergonomic **interface**&#x20;
* A fruitful **collaboration** between the various players involved in GDPR&#x20;
* **Time savings** in day-to-day compliance management&#x20;
* New compliance and management **services** and functionalities&#x20;
* A **guided** pedagogical approach to empower non-experts step by step&#x20;

At Dastra, we believe that data protection is not just a legal matter, it's also a **matter of code, expertise, project management and operations**.&#x20;
