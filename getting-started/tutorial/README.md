## Use case (fictional): The SHIPBUILDER company

You are the business manager of SHIPBUILDER, an organization that builds boats. It's made up of 8 departments:

* HR
* General Secretary
* Delivery
* Sales & Marketing
* Security
* IT
* Law
* Procurement

You have decided to bring your company into compliance with the GDPR. After learning what GDPR is, you start without further delay.

Start by setting up your workspace in Dastra:

{% content-ref url="step-1-setting-up.md" %}
[step-1-setting-up.md](step-1-setting-up.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then set up the record and map your data:

{% content-ref url="step-2-map-your-personal-data-processing-and-draw-up-a-register.md" %}
[step-2-map-your-personal-data-processing-and-draw-up-a-register.md](step-2-map-your-personal-data-processing-and-draw-up-a-register.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then manage your risks:

{% content-ref url="step-3-managing-risks.md" %}
[step-3-managing-risks.md](step-3-managing-risks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then prioritize the remedial actions to be taken:

{% content-ref url="step-4-prioritize-actions.md" %}
[step-4-prioritize-actions.md](step-4-prioritize-actions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Implement the processes required by the GDPR:

{% content-ref url="step-5-implement-internal-processes.md" %}
[step-5-implement-internal-processes.md](step-5-implement-internal-processes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Finally, centralize your compliance documentation, in particular to deal with any inspections by the supervisory authority (such as the French CNIL), and provide additional information to operational staff:

{% content-ref url="step-6-document-compliance.md" %}
[step-6-document-compliance.md](step-6-document-compliance.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
