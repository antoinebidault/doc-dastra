# Step 5: Implement internal processes

To ensure a high level of personal data protection at all times, you must put in place internal procedures to guarantee that data protection is taken into account at all times, taking into account all events that may occur during the life of a processing operation (e.g. security breach, management of rectification or access requests, modification of collected data, change of service provider).

Dastra enables you to digitize and automate at least some of the following internal processes:

* **Managing requests to exercise rights:**

[gerer-les-exercices-des-droits](../../features/gerer-les-exercices-des-droits/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Managing consent to cookies:**

{% content-ref url="../../features/gerer-le-consentement-aux-cookies/" %}
[gerer-le-consentement-aux-cookies](../../features/gerer-le-consentement-aux-cookies/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Managing data breach notifications:**

{% content-ref url="../../features/notifier-les-violations-de-donnees/" %}
[notifier-les-violations-de-donnees](../../features/notifier-les-violations-de-donnees/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
