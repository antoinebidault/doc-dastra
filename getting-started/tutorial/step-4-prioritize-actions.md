# Step 4: Prioritize actions

Once the register has been compiled and on the basis of it, you set about listing all the tasks to be carried out to comply with the current and future obligations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Then, you prioritize these actions in light of the risks posed by your processing operations to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Not sure where to start? The [CNIL's guide to personal data security](https://www.cnil.fr/en/gdpr-developers-guide) is a good place to start.

Once you have identified the actions required to complete your compliance project, you create the associated tasks and allocate them to the associated collaborators directly in the "Planning" tab of the Dastra tool:
