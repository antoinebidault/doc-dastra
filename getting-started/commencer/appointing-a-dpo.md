# Appointing a DPO

## Appoint a DPO

The data protection officer (DPO) is the orchestra conductor for RGPD compliance.&#x20;

Article 37.1 of the RGPD (General Data Protection Regulation) **requires the appointment of a DPO** in 3 situations:&#x20;

* Where processing is carried out by a **public authority or public organization**&#x20;
* Where the **core activities** of the controller or processor consist of processing operations that **require regular and systematic large-scale monitoring of data subjects**&#x20;
* Where the **basic activities** of the controller or processor consist of **large-scale processing** of special categories of data or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences

The DPO is added as an actor. So, if the DPO is a natural person, add him as a natural person. If the DPO is a company (an external DPO, for example), add him/her as a legal entity.
