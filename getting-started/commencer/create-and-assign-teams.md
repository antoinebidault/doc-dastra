# Create and assign teams

### Create and assign teams&#x20;

In Dastra, users are grouped into teams, which in turn are assigned to either legal entities or departments. In this way, roles and responsibilities can be finely managed.&#x20;

### Create a new team or assign a new user to an existing team

To create a new team or assign a new user to an existing team, click on the "Settings" button at the bottom left of the screen, then on the "Teams" button.

To create a team, click on the "Add team" button.&#x20;

To add a user to an existing team, click on the 3 dots to the right of the team and then on edit, or directly on the team name. The list of users assigned to this team is displayed, and you can add the desired users, or send an invitation to a new user.
