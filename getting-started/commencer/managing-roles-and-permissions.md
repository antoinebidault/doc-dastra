# Managing roles and permissions

When inviting a user, Dastra offers **three possible roles** by default:&#x20;

* **Administrator**: Administrators have contributor rights and can administer workspace settings. Administrators are the only ones who can set a treatment to "published" status, create organizational units and invite new users to the workspace.&#x20;
* **Contributor**: Contributors can read and edit workspace content. They can create items and modify drafts that have not yet been published. They cannot modify workspace settings.&#x20;
* **Reader**: Readers can only view workspace content. They cannot edit content or modify workspace settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only **owners** can modify organization account settings and create workspaces.
{% endhint %}

## Assigning a role to a user

In Dastra, a user can have several different roles. To assign several roles to a user, go to the "Users" section of the settings

then display user-related options

and select the "role" corresponding to the user in question.

However, it's possible to create customized roles, potentially more suited to your organization.

## Create a custom role&#x20;

To create a custom role, you must be the owner of the organization. Simply go to Organization settings, and "Roles and permissions".

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the organization's owners can access the roles and permissions management screen.
{% endhint %}

To create a new role, click on "Creat new role", give it a name and then tick the "Read", "Modify", "Import" and "Export" options linked to each functionality. Once finished, click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
To be effective, the new role must be assigned to one or more users. To do this, go to the "User" section, then click on the "Role" button corresponding to the user in question.
{% endhint %}

That's it, roles and permissions are set! You can now view the tutorial or start exploring Dastra's features on your own.
