# Add a lead authority

Within the entity, you can add a lead authority.&#x20;

If you are an organization that carries out cross-border data processing, you can benefit from the "**one-stop shop**" mechanism for all processing activities on European territory.&#x20;

This contact is the "**lead**" supervisory authority.

**For example, CNIL is the lead authority for cross-border processing carried out by organizations:**&#x20;

* which have several establishments in the European Union and whose head office is located in France, if this establishment decides on the purposes and means of the cross-border processing;&#x20;
* which have several establishments in the European Union, whose head office does not decide on the purposes and means of cross-border processing, but whose establishment which takes these decisions is located in France;&#x20;
* have a single establishment in the European Union, located in France.

### Is it compulsory?

No, it's not compulsory to designate a lead authority, nor to designate yourself to one. However, it is very useful for managing your compliance.&#x20;

We recommend that you identify it. In particular, it will be useful to know which authority is to receive a data breach notification in the event of cross-border processing.
