## Workspace

A workspace is an organization that accommodates one or more treatment registers. You can create a workspace by treatment register and/or by legal entity or branch, as you wish.

### Create a workspace

You need a workspace to manage your entity. You can create a workspace by clicking on "New workspace":

Fill in the fields, then click on "Continue".

## Invite first-time users

Once you've created your workspace, you can invite your colleagues directly to your space.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add existing users to this area, or invite new users, by clicking on the "Invite a user" button.
{% endhint %}

Assign them the role of your choice and click "Next".

## Create the first entity

In Dastra, the notion of workspace is decoupled from that of legal entity. A workspace can therefore refer to several distinct legal entities (as in a group, for example). On the other hand, there can only be one legal representative per legal entity.&#x20;

Each entity is considered a data controller.&#x20;

To create the first legal entity, all you need to do is indicate its name and associate its data controller (the legal representative) and, if appointed, the data protection officer or other parties. Only the name of the legal entity is mandatory.

Fill in the fields, then click on "Continue" to enter your space.

## Create other entities and departments (optional)

Once you've opened your workspace, it's a good idea **to fill in all other legal entities and departments immediately**, to simplify the subsequent management of processes and the allocation of user rights.&#x20;

To do this, click on the name of your entity at the top left of the screen (in this case, the "Test" button) to display the drop-down menu, then click on the "Manage your workspace" button.

This takes you to the entity and department configuration screen. Create departments by clicking on the "Create a department" button, or a new legal entity by clicking on the "Create an entity (controller" button), until the organizational diagram of your structure is displayed in Dastra.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also add sub-departments by clicking on the "add a child department" button.
{% endhint %}
