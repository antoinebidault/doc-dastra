# Request support

Sometimes the problem you're experiencing can't be solved through this documentation, the dastronaute assistant or online help.&#x20;

In this case, Dastra gives you the option of contacting us directly from the application, either via the "Help" button at the bottom left of the screen, or by accessing the support request questionnaire at the top right of the screen:

## Support request questionnaire

After clicking on the support button, a window appears in the application, allowing you to select the subject of your request. Choose one of the five possible options, detail your response and click on the "Provide feedback" button.

Your support request has been sent! Our team will get back to you as soon as possible.&#x20;

## Chat&#x20;

If your problem is urgent, or if you'd like to have an easy chat with us, you can now contact us directly via Crisp chat. This application lets you chat live with one of our team members. You can access it via the help panel, or by clicking on the dastronaute assistant and then on "chat with us".&#x20;

## Other requests&#x20;

If you have another type of request, or if you haven't yet created a Dastra account, you can send us your request directly from [www.dastra.eu](https://www.dastra.eu/en), or by clicking on [this link](https://www.dastra.eu/en/contact).
