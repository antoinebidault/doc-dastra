## The First Connection Guide

The first time you log on to your workspace, Dastra offers you a tutorial that takes you through the main Dastra functions in just a few pages.&#x20;

If you wish to relaunch this guide, simply click on the "Help" button at the bottom left of the screen, then select the "**Display the guide**" option.

The Getting Started guide then relaunches and all you have to do is follow the steps.
