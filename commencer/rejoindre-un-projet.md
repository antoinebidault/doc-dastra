# Joining a project

## Generate invitation links

You can bring someone to collaborate on your spaces by inviting them to the organization the space belongs to.

You can invite users to your workspace by selecting "settings", then "access management / Users" and then "invite user":

You can generate invitation links with different permission levels:

* **Administrator**: They can do everything writers can do, plus change the organization and spaces settings.
* **Contributor:** They can read and edit spaces. They can see drafts and changes that are not yet published. They can publish changes. They cannot edit the organization settings, nor the spaces settings.
* **Readers**: Can only visit the published spaces in organization. They cannot edit, and cannot see changes that are not yet published.

Once you have filled the information, click on "send an invitation" to share it with people you want to invite.
