## Workspace

A workspace is an organization which data protection is under the responsibility of a Data Protection Officer \(DPO\). You can create a workspace by record of processing and/or legal entity/branch.

### Create a workspace

You need a workspace to create an organization. If you don't have one already, you will be able to create one and create your first workspace in the process.  
Once the account is created, you can create a space by clicking on "New Project":
